### Introduction

This document is designed for advanced users and developers interested in deploying the Bioengine on Kubernetes. We utilise Helm charts to streamline the deployment process on the cloud.

### Resources

**1. Helm Chart for Deployment**

For deploying the Bioengine using Kubernetes, we provide a Helm chart. Detailed instructions and necessary files can be found in our GitHub repository:
